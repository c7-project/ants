## Development Notes

- **We're using the [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) formatting standard** to make sure our code is all nice and tidy
- **Keep commit titles short**, but feel free to add longer descriptions (in PyCharm enter two new lines below title for description)
- When committing some work related to an issue, **reference the issue in the commit title as '#X'**, where X is the issue number
- **Look at the issues page** often. The issues are prioritised and will help keep track of development. Don't start impulsively developing a brand new feature before planning and discussing it with the team
- If you're unsure of anything to do with development or the true meaning of life, **ask [James](https://github.com/jamesevickery)**
